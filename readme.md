**Title:** Python Script for Counting 1-Cells with Neighboring 0-Cells in 2D Matrices

**Author:** Nemat Kianezhad

**Description:**

This Python script effectively counts the number of "1" cells within a 2D matrix that possess at least one adjacent "0" cell. It leverages the pandas library for data manipulation and employs a straightforward algorithm for cell evaluation.

**Key Features:**

- User-friendly input mechanism for matrix dimensions and cell values.
- Clear and concise code structure for readability and maintainability.
- Efficient utilization of pandas for data management and analysis.

**Installation:**

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
2. Install the pandas library using pip: `pip install pandas`

**Usage:**

1. Execute the script from your terminal: `python count_neighboring_cells.py`
2. Follow the prompts to input the matrix dimensions and cell values.
3. The script will output the count of qualifying "1" cells.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Integration of error handling routines for invalid input.
- Exploration of potential performance optimizations for handling large-scale matrices.
- Potential expansion to accommodate matrices with diverse value types.
